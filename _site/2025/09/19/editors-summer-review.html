<h2 id="sophia-fang-26">Sophia Fang ‘26:</h2>
<p>…“protected” my five-year-old sister from the neighbor’s cow (she swore it had beef with her), tried to befriend a foul-smelling horse, and tore through a towering corn maze in a game of tag with my younger cousins.</p>

<p>Sitting in a bustling corner café with two drinks, three Word docs, and too many Google Chrome tabs open to count, I was thrilled when my mom called with the word “vacation.” I had imagined an adventure abroad, with hot springs and plane tickets. But turns out she meant I was going to visit relatives in the countryside - “回老家”.</p>

<p>So while others were racking up passport stamps, I boarded a slow train to Shandong, back to grandparents, cousins, and the quiet sprawl of rural Northern China. I was always a tight-schedule city girl, but over the next three days, all my work was forcibly put on pause. Over sunflower seeds and night air thick with crickets, I stopped checking the time altogether for the next few days.</p>

<p>Deadlines, plans, checklists—sometimes it feels as if we’re always sprinting through life. But during those nights, despite leaves rustling and cicadas buzzing in the distance, I experienced a rare kind of silence: the quieting of the mind. I had stepped out of a race I’d been running my whole life, if only briefly, if only for days. And for a few days, everything was okay.</p>

<p>On the train ride back, I listened to podcasts, music, and audiobooks in a daze, unsure if I was “using” my time well (I had promised myself I’d start my English HL essay; spoiler alert: I didn’t). But maybe that’s also okay. Maybe racing against time doesn’t always mean running full speed—you just need to take the scenic route when you need it.</p>

<h2 id="ariel-zhang-27">Ariel Zhang ‘27:</h2>
<p>…stopped worrying about academics and stopped to observe the overlooked spirit of American metropolises.</p>

<p>This summer, my family and I traveled back to the United States for around a month, visiting New York, Boston, and Chicago. I’ve stayed in all three places before, so this time I was coming back not as a tourist, but as a wanderer drawn to each city’s overlooked details.</p>

<p>In my phone’s Notes app, I have an entry that notes down sparks of inspiration from anything I feel with my five senses. I see a pretty leaf and I write a paragraph; I hear a ukulele plucking on a park bench and I type a sentence. I tend to forget these small moments, but they’re often the very moments that draw the writer and the reader to the shared experience of being human. Out of the many sentences I blurt out with typed letters, some might not be the best, but there will always be a line that lands with quiet weight. And so, this summer was a great chance to find inspiration by just observing. And seeing my notes app getting pretty long, I think it’s a good sign that I’m getting more inspired.</p>

<h2 id="cheer-yu-27">Cheer Yu ‘27:</h2>
<p>…sketched in the RISD Museum among ancient Egyptian artifacts and Renaissance paintings, shared newfound laughs over surprisingly good cafeteria food, and chased sunsets at India Point Park while someone strummed a guitar nearby.</p>

<p>This summer in Providence, RI, was an exciting mix of creativity and discoveries for me—like a quick lesson in seeing the world through an artist’s eyes. The constant activity of making art (and the inevitable sleep deprivation) was balanced by quiet moments by the lake as the sky turned golden. It’s a lot like working on TIMES: both depend on teamwork, unexpected bursts of inspiration (those late-night doodles that spark ideas), and finding beauty in the little things.</p>

<p>Living between the RISD and Brown campuses, I loved how Providence became a classroom in and of itself. The smell of spicy málà noodles from a tiny restaurant and a busker’s accordion music echoing down Benefit Street were the primary sources of the heritage that underlies this place. Even just wandering through Providence’s cobblestone streets, it felt like my mind was editing — curating moments (a perfect bowl of ramen, a sudden breeze) into something cohesive.</p>

<p>If TIMES is about capturing the spirit of our community, this summer taught me to pay even more attention to the hum of ideas in group discussions, the rustling leaves in the park, and that quiet “click” when different pieces finally come together in people.</p>

<h2 id="ryan-he-27">Ryan He ‘27:</h2>
<p>…reintertwined with a place I haven’t been for over a decade.</p>

<p>Hiya! My name is Ryan, and I’m a rising junior. I’m from the suburbs of Tāmaki Makaurau Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand, which I have to admit I’m now a stranger to. This summer, I traveled to the Pacific country for the first time in a decade. I stayed in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington and Auckland, both for a week, and they showed me wrath and kindness in their downpours and sun glares. And I got my driver’s license too!</p>

<p>If you ever come down to New Zealand, I implore you to sit with my city for longer than your regular tourist will. Because when pigeons flock above Albert Street, when Avondale’s hills oscillate under your electric scooter, and when “Ribs” plays over the Harbour Bridge at night, you’ll realize that my gray-blue city courses electric currents. When you talk to the nicest people there’ll ever be and hear their qualms and hopes despite, you’ll realize that even though butter is 15$, these cities and their people live on. There’s still time for aroha, no matter where we are on the Overton window.</p>

<h2 id="aaron-xue-26">Aaron Xue ‘26:</h2>
<p>…spent my summer* in the south.</p>

<p>*Well, not quite… It’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere. This summer, I traveled down to Sydney, Australia. While it wasn’t exactly a tropical paradise, I found warmth, paradoxically, within the chilly winds of Sydney, and I had the time of my life exploring the city and its suburbs. I always try to find the bright side of things, and in Sydney, I found it at Bondi Beach, the Royal Botanic Garden, and within the city itself. I was inspired by the conservation of nature, both on land and deep in the harbor. The natural beauty of Sydney absolutely fascinates me.</p>

<p>As an avid traveller, I enjoy experiencing new things. I learned to quickly adapt to the cold breeze and a truly diverse culture. From Vegemite and Milo to Vietnamese banh mi, and among numerous kinds of people, Sydney’s inclusivity was something I truly appreciated as a third-culture kid. It felt like a comfortable mix of Western, Eastern, Southeast Asian, and everything else in between. I could feel the pulse of a vibrant global culture everywhere I went. In Sydney, I decided to slow down, take a deep breath, and truly appreciate the people, the environment, and the simple feeling of being alive. There’s no race, no worries, no hurry – I’m just living, learning, and enjoying where I am.</p>

<h2 id="chelsea-nam-26">Chelsea Nam ‘26:</h2>
<p>…dedicated my weekdays to exploring the city in earnest.</p>

<p>Hello! I’m Chelsea, a rising senior :) I lived in Shanghai for 17 years, but it has recently dawned on me that I am far less familiar with my district and this city than I had imagined.  So this July, I dedicated my weekdays to exploring the city in earnest. After all, when people ask me where I grew up, I would like to be able to proudly say Shanghai and, on the side, recommend the deep cuts of the city.</p>

<p>Rather than hopping around for tourist attractions or famous photo landmarks, I tried to find the beauty and joy in the little things and search for the hidden gems. Starting from the comfort of my own neighborhood, I biked around to find the best study spots: from Pain Chaud bakeries and Gaga office to random, cute roadside coffee shops. I even found the coziest bookstores and libraries. To squeeze in exercise between college applications and the IB lifestyle, I explored different gyms in my free time and developed my love-hate relationship with the stairmaster. And, I can proudly say I know the best gelato pop-ups.</p>

<p>Perhaps the tones of the summer were a little quotidian, but in those quiet and mundane moments, I found a deeper connection to the city I call home.</p>

<h2 id="liris-zheng-27">Liris Zheng ‘27:</h2>
<p>…finally got the chance to reclaim my childhood Terabithia.</p>

<p>The Maldives’ western winds blew my hair back as I peered across the horizon, the harsh sunlight blurring lines between ocean and sky - it’s a mesmerizing canvas of blues and emeralds. The Maldives has been my favorite vacation destination ever since I first visited when I was 9. I love lying in the hammock outside with a book in my hand, taking everything in: the sunlight, the breeze, the naturally soothing rhythms of the ocean and migrating seagulls flapping their wings above it. But honestly, I was never really reading; I would doze off into the allure of the Indian Ocean.</p>

<p>One must, however, be vigilant of the sky, as the weather in these islands can be volatile. The gentle and persistent waves would push against your face again and again, the salty seawater entering your nostrils and throat - exhaustive and slowly suffocating. Every year, tourists would lose their lives in the Indian Ocean, mistaking its beauty and serenity for safety, and underestimating the innate power and danger of nature. This need for care treading these waters is somewhat like how I contribute to journalism in the Times. There’s a pursuit for truth and expression in everything I write, and that requires me to always be careful.</p>

<p>Tranquil, shimmering, and vast.</p>

<p>To the Maldives, (once again) my natural sanctuary from the hustle of high school life.</p>

<h2 id="andrea-yang-27">Andrea Yang ‘27:</h2>
<p>…continued another year of a family tradition.</p>

<p>Some people hate road trips. I could not disagree more. I so happen to come from a family that has made it a customary summer event. In August, I spent 24 whirlwind days in the smallest car imaginable, looping through 12 central and eastern European countries. This included Czechia, Germany, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Croatia, Hungary, Slovenia, and Slovakia.</p>

<p>I learned a lot over the past month. This also included, but was not limited to:
Paying for the bathrooms is taking advantage of a basic human necessity.
Biking culture is cool — until you nearly get run over by a 12-year-old doing 30 km/hr on a cargo bike.
Castles are everywhere, and yes, it does feel like you’re in a fantasy novel.
Beer is not just a beverage. It is a religion.</p>

<p>But somewhere between the border checkpoints, I started thinking about what it really means to move through the world — not just as a tourist, but as a guest in someone else’s everyday life. Traveling this way made me realize how easy it is to live inside your own bubble, to assume yourself in the way you think, speak, or view things as the default. Every unfamiliar street sign or small-town conversation reminded me how many ways there are to live a life. While we struggle to keep up with the fast-paced city life of an international school student, somewhere else in the world, someone is lying on their back, watching the sky change colors, because that is their way of telling the time. They are doing nothing else, and they don’t need a reason or a lame excuse.
Every country, every town, every street was a little different. The world doesn’t shrink when you explore it. It expands. Suddenly, there are more ways to say hello. More kinds of normal. More versions of home.</p>

<h2 id="chingmo-zhou-27">Chingmo Zhou ‘27:</h2>
<p>…made a plan to have no plan in the largest city in the world.</p>

<p>Going to Tokyo for the first time, I decided rather than following my parents’ intricately designed travel guides, which was always the norm, I’d try something new: a plan to have no plan. Every day, my mom and I went wherever we felt like going, our plans drifting with the breeze of our hearts’ desires. We explored neighborhoods of thrift stores, hopped across all of Tokyo’s Pokémon centers, and made the pilgrimage to the 7-floor Uniqlo flagship. Sleeping till noon became a common occurrence for us as we moved with our own pace and cadence.</p>

<p>On the last day, sitting in a neighborhood ramen stand, I realized that vacation isn’t about where you go. It’s about how you get there. It’s the time spent chatting and line-hopping on the subway, the conversations with friends, and the spark of suddenly wanting to go someplace that defines a “good” vacation. We make schedules, timetables, and plans to safeguard ourselves from the prospect of an all-consuming unknown. But sometimes in life, it’s about not living with intent. Real growth and experience come from embracing change and adapting to it along the way. My unplanned vacation in Tokyo reminds me not to worry about planning my college applications, but instead to live life to the fullest and reap what gifts or curses it decides to give me.</p>

<h2 id="pete-chen-27">Pete Chen ‘27:</h2>
<p>…had a vacation that was more like a chill Jet 2 holiday. Let me tell you how it went.</p>

<p>I’m sure my fellow Times editors have already given a list of their summer vacations. That list, however, is not exhaustive: a vacation does not have to be a trip, an exploration, or an adoption of a new lifestyle. A vacation can be anything; it’s more about how you make it.
I’m Pete Chen, a rising junior. This summer, I traveled to Shenzhen and Hong Kong, but, instead of the few attractions and events I saw, what truly amazed me was how moldable the whole vacation became the deeper I went.
You see, I visited the two cities the week before the Chinese Mock Trial national championship. I was solo captain for a 6-person team representing our school’s program (SHSID Mock Trial) The tournament was coming up in a few weeks, so I would go through most days by typing edits on each of my team’s 12 scripts, heading out to a nearby mall for dinner, and then coming back to talk with my team until 11:30 P.M. or so.
Much like those “nothing beats a Jet 2 holiday” videos, I suppose this means that vacations can come in all forms, including those that aren’t breaks from work. Now, however, even as I’m holding a Team Fourth Place from the national championship in hand and am gradually picking back up the 4 magazines and 2 other clubs I’ve left behind for the tournament, I can’t help but appreciate the clear skies and calm atmosphere down in Southern China.</p>
