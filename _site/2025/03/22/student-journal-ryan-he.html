            <h1>Clocks, Expectations, and Breaking Both</h1>
        <i>For people who took the Physics Bowl</i> &nbsp; <p>By</p> <h4>Ryan He</h4>

<p>When the light stiffens on the rusted guardrails, as I rush inside the door frame back home, the clock runs above my parents, whose mouths are running at lightning speed, in a conversation that goes a little bit like this: The majority of us are going to live the same life. We’re going to get the same internships at the same consulting firms, work the same jobs that make us money, get married, have children, find retirement plans, then retire and yada yada. They then glance at me, brimming with excitement about this comfortable life. This kind of life is comfortable, a testament to a million comfortable people that lives in a million cities, living a million lives, a million comfortable people. But when you write it out in plain text, it seems scary, right? At least, to me, who’s writing it out in plain text for you, it sure is. I’m afraid that the adults are right.</p>

<p>Keynote slides fly through by speeches and I still swallow down this same conversation as I sit under the elevated platform of the Auditorium; I sit a step under. Footsteps through the corridors and I still swallow down this conversation from those around me. Hustled whispers spread an almost poisonous certainty. Apparently, all that people can talk about is AP and IB. Apparently, all that people care about are physics questions had on last night’s exam. In the great span of this world, all that we could debate is some school red tape that suddenly becomes our entire personality. Apparently.</p>

<p>And then everything turns into machine code. You either get into this university or not. You either get this grade point or not. You either have other people slap a badge of approvement on you and let everyone crowd around you, admiring the way your stylized hair flows and the way your a score writ in red on your exam paper somehow symbolizes your accoladed self - or you mean nothing to an ever polarizing, ever surface-crawling world.</p>

<p>…and in return for these toils, I’ll get a high-paying job at a top-edge medical firm. I’ll find a wife, have children, file 401(k)s and 1040s (unlike how bad Evelyn Wang did it in <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once) and, lastly, finally, then I’ll live out the rest of my life in comfort. And the adults were</em> right. And I’ll go ahead and tell my kids about how right my parents were, how right <em>I</em> am, how <em>no, you’re actually wrong</em>, and <em>yeah, I’m right</em>, and -</p>

<p>And now it’s scary for you, too, right? You drop the Physics Bowl questions and stare at your hands. The clock in your room is ticking one second at a time. It’s a prickling, unsettling sound.</p>

<p>I remember laying awake at midnight when I was 7, because of a clock that I hung opposite at the top of my room. I couldn’t sleep with that tick-tick-tick sound coming one after another. It’s an emblem that after one second, comes another. Then comes another. It’s all so predictable. And I thought, maybe if there’s something I can do to have that strangling sound of predictiveness and uneasiness go away, that’s the least I could do.</p>

<p>So, maybe the adults are wrong -</p>

<p>Maybe they’ll find a broken clock at the end of the staircase and reprimand the culprit of this disturber of peace. Maybe I’ll be called a destructive, unruly, all sorts of bad names. They’ll say I ruined the aesthetic of the room. That it took them hours to hang it. But in the morning, I would’ve won back something I lost so long ago when I stared blankly at the principal, smirking with joy as he lists out the framework that we’ll use to draw boxes around our four years in high school. So long ago, when I started to believe that I should do something because my parents would be happy if I did it. Or when a spark in all of us started to dim when all we could hear was a cacophony of voices outside of us, telling us to do this or do that.</p>

<p>We’ll be let out of our little houses of cultural expectations and empty insides when we break our clocks. When we talk back. When we stop trying to fit in. When we make things with genuine care. When we stop copying answers off of ChatGPT. When we educate ourselves to think critically about real, <em>real</em> things. When we discover and embrace the things that make us different, and when we, united with our proudly-held differences, bow down with a purpose to create real, unyielding impact for us and others. When we foster just a little hope in our student body and keep it going, so that our people don’t lack purpose, drive, and sleep. When we are kind to our whanau and the people around us, because we want to be treated the same way we treat people. When we fight back against hate and bigotry, mundaneness and conformity, even if it’s what is being taught to us. And then, maybe, we’ll prove that we don’t need to live under the same timelines and storylines, and that <em>No, actually, you’re wrong, and I’m right, and I’ll always be right</em>. ⬤</p>
