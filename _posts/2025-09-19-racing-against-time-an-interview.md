**JENNIFER KIM**
For those unfamiliar, what exactly is GT Racing?

Tom: GT Racing is a club where we utilize skills from multiple disciplines, including physics, engineering, math, finance, business management, design, and the arts. Together, we don’t just support a motorsports team; we ask ourselves, “how do we win a championship?” This includes competitions like the Ten80 National STEM League Racing Challenge 2025 nationals.

The club started in 2017 and has come a long way, thanks to various groups of people who have led us to the global stage, including the US nationals, which are essentially the world finals. The last time we reached this level was last year, and, prior to that, it was during the club’s founding with a different team.
 
I’m fairly new to the club, having joined in my sophomore year last year. Over this past year, I’ve learned how our team operates. It’s not just about performing well in competitions; it’s also about leaving a lasting impression on judges and teams, both in China and the US. We aim to distinguish ourselves not only through cutting-edge technology that helps us win races but also through our team culture.
 
We have fun during our club sessions, but the overall vibe during our trips to competitions really motivates us to push further as a team. Even though we focus on just one competition, we are constantly striving to expand our influence. Last year, we worked on increasing our presence within our school by teaching younger students and recruiting new members (including myself). In the coming years, we want to explore how we can promote our passion for RC cars and motorsports to the broader international high school community and even worldwide. We’ve already communicated with teams in the United States.

**LIRIS ZHENG**
So, we know you guys won this competition in Charlotte. What were some of the challenges you faced during the competition, and how did you overcome them?

DJ: I’ll talk about the engineering part. I think the major difficulty in the US is we don’t really know the track over there. They do have a track overview in the packet they gave us for the American round, but the actual track could change because of the weather conditions. In this year’s competition, the whole track system changed because of rain, with the track conditions also changing. It became just concrete, and it was really bad for our car because we never tested on concrete. Yeah, the road was all slippery. So, I guess the way we coped was to test out different car tires on our car to see which one went best with the course. 

Tony Xie: Another challenge that we had that was not only during the competition and has been around us for a long time is: where do we get the money? As you know, racing is very costly. We spent a lot of money in  innovating, designing new parts, conducting experiments and all that. There’s a lot of things you have to buy in machinery, so it just makes funding this whole team really difficult. We have to find sponsors. You’ve probably noticed the jackets that we wear had our sponsors up there. But it’s really hard to get sponsors, you have to find new angles and try to understand why it’s valuable for them to choose us for sponsorship.


Another thing is all about keeping up with the integrity of the school. We’ve seen a lot of companies who want to leverage our school’s influence, and they want to brand themselves with that. We just have to keep in mind that, and, even if we’re in need for money, we still have to keep our baseline standards, which is really important in running a club like this. The club hasn’t been here for two or three years. It’s been here for seven or eight years. So, you have to keep this legacy going on, making this club sustainable, which is really important towards financing.
 
Chris: There are also some challenges for the design department, so I think the challenge for any kind of race, not just the one in GT Racing, is the balance between subjectivity and objectivity. In other words, what the designers are looking for in design might not always be what others, like judges, are favoring. Art is something that’s highly subjective, and not everyone is expected to understand or appreciate it.
 
Thus, finding the balance between what designers wish they designed and what is expected in the rubric for the competition is essential. And I think we’ve done a pretty good job in finding that balance. And I mean, it’s actually quite tough. We often get to arguments about what this design is supposed to look like. But I think we eventually resolved it, and we had made a pretty good effort to find the balance, and we got a pretty good score. 

**LIRIS ZHENG**
If you could take away one thing or idea or memory from Charlotte or any other  competition, what would be and why?

Aichen: One key takeaway I have is that the experience itself was probably the most important part of the competition. Meeting people from different cultures and schools was invaluable. Last year, we were one of only two Chinese teams attending the competition in the U.S., while the rest were American teams.
 
We had the opportunity to talk to them about their innovations, engineering practices, and how their teams operated, which gave us a great idea of how our club should function in the future. For example, we met the champion team, Ram Tech 59, who had won three times in a row and is considered one of the best teams in the world. After the competition, we asked them how they designed their project and about their experiences, 
which helped us understand what led to their success.
 
We learned a lot from those interactions, built new relationships, and that ultimately contributed to our own success.
 

**LIRIS ZHENG**
What legacy or impact do you hope GT Racing will leave on the school or future students?
 
Tony: From the start, we’ve always had this mindset of passing down the knowledge that we have. Back when the club was founded, we had a really smart crew. You know, they were rocking through the China Invitationals, they were always in the US rounds, they did great, and they were very influential in the school. But, after graduation, they basically didn’t leave anything for us. Now, for our former leaders Evan and Steve, they didn’t really have those resources that they should have inherited. After that, Evan, Steve, Aichen, we all brought this club back. We’re always thinking about what core foundational values that we have to make sure always exist. So it’s a legacy. We have to keep this legacy, of course, because this is a very old club and we hope that more people will join this club and keep making astonishing results.

We also think education is really important because even if you have those resources and you have tools and cars, if but you don’t know how to fix everything or how to make things improve, it’s not going to work. And I think it’s just that giving this education allows for more innovations for the team, which is really important because we have to improve. We don’t want to see the occasion that we saw previously where we basically left nothing for the team, and we just want for the next generation to grow, to become better, better than us, of course, maybe even dominate the US rounds. Because this time, I’ll say that we definitely won by our performance vote. Definitely, we weren’t having a huge difference with the other teams. So if we don’t improve ourselves, they will catch up and maybe we’ll lose, and this is something that we don’t see. 
 
Aichen: I think we not only want to leave a lasting legacy on our future members and the school itself, but we also want to leave a legacy in this racing community, in RC racing, in competitions from China all the way to international ones. By doing so, we set a goal to inspire other people to innovate. One of our goals is to try to create our innovations ourselves and also inspire teams from across China and across the world to follow our steps on creating new innovations.

Since racing competitions have only been around for less than ten years or so in China, teams haven’t already experienced or touched on the borders of the rules, and what we try to do is we find the limits of our engineering capabilities. That’s the goal of racing and competitive racing. You’re trying to find the limits of where you can reach, how fast you can drive, what’s the best car you can innovate, what’s the most inspirational business presentation you can make, what’s the best-looking design logo, etc. And, all of these come down to not only our teams that work in different fields, but also us being able to expand our influence across different communities and sharing everything.
 
 
**PETE CHEN**
When you’re racing, is it always best to have everything go as fast as possible?
Felix: Not exactly. So, at first we tried to build the fastest cars we could, and we discovered that, in the China Round, when we tried a car that was built very fast, it turned out to be detrimental to our race because when the car goes faster, it’s much harder to control. That model of car, we made it fast, but it’s also very easy to break because there’s many moving parts that are not made of metal and could be plastic. That was how we lost a 30 minute-endurance race. We lost that race because the car was going too fast, it crashed, and we were unable to fix it during the race. But later, we decided to use a slower but stronger car, and then we were able to complete the entire endurance race without crashing the car even once and the car didn’t break. Because it was an endurance race, the key wasn’t actually to have the fastest car, it was to just be consistent and make sure that we don’t get eliminated.


**PETE CHEN**
Do you think the same goes for time? Would you want time to be as fast as possible or not too fast, not too slow or maybe slower? 

Tony: For sure! You know, especially for us, time is really limited. After the China Round, all we have is just around two months before the next competition.We definitely wish there was more time for us to prepare because the more time we have, the more experiments we can do, maybe we can get more money just to fund everything. It’s really busy, so, at that time we would definitely wish that time flows much slower because that would be just much more beneficial.

It’s my personal experience, but sometimes I actually also wish the time was flowing faster. Sometimes it’s more like, especially when you’re after a season, like how last year, when we finished the US Finals, we were trying to come back and work for the new season and I thought that this long duration, it was kind of (boring). I mean, racing is really fun. I think for everyone here (at the club), we love racing from our hearts. We’re just excited to be back at racing, participate in the events, and have some real excitement. Maybe at that time we would want time to flow faster.
 

**PETE CHEN**
Our issue is called “RACING AGAINST TIME”. At GT Racing, do you all think that you’re sometimes racing against time? 

John: I think our club is kind of racing with time because our club is growing both physically and mentally over time. I think compared to when I first joined the club, every member of our club now has probably greater confidence and belief in ourselves, so I think time is making our club stronger. I think our club is racing with the time, and time has helped us grow from a small team to a pretty influential club at SHSID.
  

**PETE CHEN** 
Do you guys think you can win this race against time? Why or why not? 

Tony: I think that we’re going to win against time because time is the only factor that is equal for every competitor in competitions. We’re all handed the same amount of time.

Just to talk about how motivated we are: our group chat has been named “Champions” since the start of the school year. It was not after we went number one and then we changed the name. It was named that from the start. We always knew that, with the limited time, with the limited resources, we’re definitely going to win this fight because (our dedication) is what makes us different, because we’re passionate about racing. We’re passionate about motorsport, we’re energized, and we have this commitment into the things that we love to work on. I think all of that really contributes to building this winning mentality for our team and I think that is definitely going to stay because everyone here knows we’re going to win if we put enough effort and dedicate ourselves into this big race. Good things will always appear, it’s just a reflection of the effort that we put into this competition. 
 
Aichen: Leading this club, I can see growth in our team. I can see a potential increase in future achievements. Because in order to beat time, I believe the most crucial thing is passion, your passion for this club, your passion for racing, your passion for engineering, business design, public relations, and everything.

I think we can beat time through these engineering innovations, these passed-on ideas that don’t really die. I can see how the future generation might be even more motivated than us. They seem very interested in our club, they seem very interested in racing itself and our competitions and they will definitely achieve a higher success than us. With Tom leading GT Racing next year, and I think he can also approach this perspective on time and legacy as well. ⬤
